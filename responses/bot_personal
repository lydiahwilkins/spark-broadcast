It's not about you, or me, or anybody. It's all Webex, all the time.
Next time we meet outside of work, let's talk. For now… let's focus on Webex feature announcements.
I'd rather we talk about something else. Ask for help if you're not sure what to talk about.
My developers don't let me talk about anything other than Webex new feature announcements.
Hmmm… Let me think on that. In the meantime, Webex is neato, right?
