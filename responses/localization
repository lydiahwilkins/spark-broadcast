I wish I could speak another language… at least one of the 20+ that Webex supports.
Even though Webex supports over 20 languages, I only know English.
I spent my early years studying Latin… turns out no one speaks it anymore (not even me). It's not even one of the 20+ languages that Webex supports. Go figure.
It's on my to-do list to learn at least one language other than English.
